    "description": "This class starts with a discussion of mathematical logic. Logic is the basis of all mathematical reasoning, and of all automated reasoning. It has practical applications to the design of computing machines, to the specification of systems, to artificial intelligence, to computer programming, to programming languages, and to other areas of computer science, as well as to many other fields of study.  Discrete Structures: students will be able to work with discrete structures, which are the abstract mathematical structures used to represent discrete objects and relationships between these objects. These discrete structures include sets, permutations, relations, graphs, and trees. Next is Combinatorial Analysis: an important problem-solving skill is the ability to count or enumerate objects. The discussion of enumeration in this book begins with the basic techniques of counting. The stress is on performing combinatorial analysis to solve counting problems and analyze algorithms, not on applying formulae. Certain classes of problems are solved by the specification of an algorithm. After an algorithm has been described, a computer program can be constructed implementing it. The mathematical portions of this activity, which include the specification of the algorithm, the verification that it works properly are all covered in this course.",

Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics.  Analytic geometry, also called coordinate geometry, mathematical subject in which algebraic symbolism and methods  are used to represent and solve problems in geometry.  The importance of analytic geometry is that it establishes a  correspondence between geometric curves and algebraic equations. Student can use the knowledge of the given  course in order to construct the mathematical models in economy and business.",

The goal of the course is to acquaint the students with rigorous proofs in analysis and also to set a firm foundation for calculus of one variable. The course consists of concepts such as sets, functions, sequences and their limits, series of numbers, tests for convergence, concepts of alternating series, absolute and conditional convergence, power series. Taylor’s series, the study of functions using the methods of differential calculus.",
